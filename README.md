# Cerulean Plugins

**Cerulean Plugins** is a plugins suite for Apache Cordova (at the moment it's Android only), developed to be used in **CeruleanWhisper** protected comms software.

Programming languages thus include Java, Androids' RenderScript, C/C++, shell integration, HTML5, CSS3+, JS(ES6,ES7+).

Architecturally it's one large plugin, exporting many methods. Once a sub-plugin matures (with rule of thumb being crossing the 0.1.0 version),
it is rewarded with a separate repository for further developement.

At the moment there are only two plugins in the suite:
* blinkFlash, standing at version 0.1.0, and
* blinkWatch, currently at 0.0.2
